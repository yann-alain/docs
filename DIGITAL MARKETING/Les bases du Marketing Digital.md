## How to set the right goals for your Social Media Marketing Strategy?

To set the right goals for your strategy, think about the following:

1. Look back, what can you learn from previous month / years?
2. What is realistic to achieve this year?
3. Will these new goals actually help my business or are they just vanity metrics?
4. Have you communicated your new goals with colleagues and management? Do you have buy-in?
5. Do you have a process in place to easily track your progress?

## 2. Think of your organic social messaging as a cyclic customer journey

As marketers, we have this wonderful false sense that the journey a customer takes to come to a decision to buy, follows some kind of more or less linear path that we can map out. We also know that the customer journey is just a model. As such, it can help.

1. Map out what your customer is thinking, wondering, experiencing, and what she wants or needs through the phases we call Awareness, Acquisition, and Activation (or See, Think, Do). You do this by talking to your customer.
2. Translate your brand message into (5) categories, pillars, or themes for your content that answers the questions your prospective buyers might have along these phases. Read more about this below.
3. Create a cyclic customer journey with your content on [social media](https://storylab.ai/ai-for-social-media-marketing/) and the order in which you push it out, for instance, weekly. Understand that you don’t know when which person who comes across your message on their social feed, is in what phase.

### Should I create an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) for my Social Media Strategy?

We do not advise creating an  Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) for your social media strategy. This might narrow your activities too much and deter you from engaging with a larger audience. An Ideal Customer Profile has its own place in an organization, but we would not advise spending time setting that up if you don’t already have it set up to improve your Social Media Marketing Strategy.

### Should I do a Competitive Analysis for my Social Media Strategy?

It is always good to learn more about what works and what does not. For your Social Media Strategy, you can have a closer look at your competitors and see what you can learn from them. What types of posts are they creating, who is following them, who is engaging with them, etc? Don’t just look at your competitors. Take it one or several levels higher and look at what is working (and not working) in your niche / industry beyond your competitors.

### What is Social Media Listening?

Social Media Listening is setting alerts to get notifications when someone mentions you, a competitor, or topic. You often get notified when someone tags you, but sometimes, people accidentally don’t tag you properly. It’s always good to set up Social Media Listening for variations of your Social Media Handle Name. You can also set up Social Media listening to get notified when someone talks about a competitor or topic you’re interested in. Usually, you need additional Social Media Tools to set up Social Listening.

### How often do I need to do a Social Media Audit?

It’s good to do a Social Media Audit every quarter. At the end of the year, you can do a more in-depth social media audit to prepare for the year to come.

### How to do a Social Media Audit?

When doing a Social Media Audit, you can look at the following aspects:

- What is and is not working for you (check the goals you’ve set)?
- Are you posting at the frequency you’ve set for yourself?
- What types of posts are doing well / not so well?
- Which social platforms are doing well / not so well at the moment?
- Who is engaging with you on which platforms?
- Which of your relationships are the most valuable can you invite them to collaborate on a different platform?
- How does the competition’s social media presence compare to yours?
